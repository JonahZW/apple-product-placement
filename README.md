For my project, I will be exploring a dataset which compiled a list of product placement by Apple in TV shows and movies. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle at this link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadhmozafary/apples-product-placements-in-movies-and-tv-shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadhmozafary/apples-product-placements-in-movies-and-tv-shows).
