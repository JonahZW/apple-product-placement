# apple-product-placement
Jonah Werbel, DS4003 (UVA 24sp)

For my project, I will be exploring a dataset which compiled a list of product placement by Apple in TV shows and movies. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle at this link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadhmozafary/apples-product-placements-in-movies-and-tv-shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadhmozafary/apples-product-placements-in-movies-and-tv-shows).

The live app can be found at [https://apple-product-placement.onrender.com](https://apple-product-placement.onrender.com) (note, however, if it was not used recently, it may spin down with inactivity and take a couple minutes to load).
